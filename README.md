## Description:
I have a basic home page where I am able to navigate to the next note page. On the note page, I am able to type out a note then save it to the local host. When I am done, I can click on the pencil to start a new note and still see my previous notes. 

## Technologies Used:
- HTML
- CSS
- Express
- Node 


## Things I learned:
- I learned how to have an application listen to a localhost. I am still getting familiar with using Insomnia but not sure how it really works yet. I am unsure why my notes are also not saving since I feel my code is right.
